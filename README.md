The word 'algorithm' comes from 'al-Khwarizmi', named after a Persian scholar who lived around year 800.

The concept of algorithmic problem-solving can be traced back to ancient times, long before the invention of computers.

The study of Data Structures and Algorithms really took off with the invention of computers in the 1940s, to efficiently manage and process data.

Today, DSA is a key part of Computer Science education and professional programming, helping us to create faster and more powerful software.

Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures.

Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.

A cooking recipe written on a piece of paper is an example of an algorithm, where the goal is to make a certain dinner. The steps needed to make a specific dinner are described exactly.

When we talk about algorithms in Computer Science, the step-by-step instructions are written in a programming language, and instead of food ingredients, an algorithm uses data structures.

Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.

By studying algorithms, developers can write better programs.

Algorithm examples:

Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
Finding what users search for (search engine)
Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating
The algorithms we will look at in this tutorial are designed to solve specific problems, and are often made to work on specific data structures. For example, the 'Bubble Sort' algorithm is designed to sort values, and is made to work on arrays.

Data Structures together with Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, and the algorithms in this tutorial are not worth much without a data structure to work on.

DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.

By understanding DSA, you can:

Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.
Make programs that run faster or use less memory.
Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.
